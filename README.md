# Fiber Optic FPV System

A **DIY Fiber Optic-enabled FPV video and control system** designed for affordable, high-performance drone operation. This system uses off-the-shelf components to deliver interference-free communication and advanced features at a cost of around **$300**.

## Key Features
- **Fiber Optic Communication**: Reliable and interference-free in challenging environments.
- **Customizable and Open Source**: Fully programmable, allowing for custom OSD elements, unique arming methods, and feature expansion.
- **High-Performance Video**:
  - Supports **1600x900 at 60fps** and **720p at 120fps**.
- **Advanced Capabilities**:
  - Real-time trajectory estimation for precise object dropping or landings.
  - Multi-camera support for enhanced situational awareness.
  - Ground station processing for greater computational power and flexibility.

## About the Project
This project aims to provide an affordable, flexible, and customizable alternative to traditional FPV systems. While still a prototype, itâ€™s open to collaboration and feedback to refine and expand its capabilities.

## Getting Started
The **hardware guide** and **software guide** are currently a work in progress, but the basic setup will be updated soon. Stay tuned for detailed instructions!
