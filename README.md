# Fiber Optic FPV System

A **DIY Fiber Optic-enabled FPV video and control system** designed for low-cost and high-performance drone operation. This project leverages off-the-shelf components to create a robust FPV system operating entirely over fiber optic cable. All components cost approximately **$300**, with opportunities for further cost reduction.

## üåü Key Features
- **Fiber Optic Communication**: Overcomes interference issues in challenging environments.
- **High-Performance Video**:
  - Supports **1600x900 resolution at 60fps**.
  - Handles **720p resolution at 120fps** for smooth video feeds.
- **Customizable On-Screen Display (OSD)**:
  - Full control over displayed data, not limited to traditional Betaflight or INAV OSD.
  - Add unique OSD elements tailored to specific use cases.
- **Scalable Architecture**:
  - Most video processing is performed on the ground station computer, enabling higher computational power.
  - Modular design allows for easy upgrades and customization.
- **Endless Possibilities**:
  - Custom arming sequences (voice commands, keybinds, etc.).
  - Advanced features like trajectory estimation and precision object dropping.
  - Potential for multi-camera setups (e.g., spotter/copilot view).

## üìö About the Project
This project was created with two goals in mind:
1. To provide an affordable alternative to traditional FPV systems.
2. To inspire others to explore the potential of fiber optic communication in drone technology.

Although this is currently a prototype, the project is **open to collaboration and feedback**. The ultimate goal is to refine the system into a fully integrated solution with custom PCBs, advanced embedded software, and more powerful capabilities.
